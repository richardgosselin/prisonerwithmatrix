They had been partners in crime for years, and their bond seemed unbreakable. But one day, their luck ran out, and they found themselves caught by the town's sheriff.</p>	<p>The sheriff, aware of their strong partnership, decided to put them to the ultimate test using a simple game known as the "Prisoner's Dilemma". He separated Alice and Bob into two different cells, where they couldn't communicate with each other. The sheriff then presented each of them with two options: to betray their partner by testifying against them or to remain silent and loyal.</p>	<p>The sheriff explained the possible outcomes using a two-by-two matrix:</p>	<table>		<tr>			<th></th>			<th>Alice Stays Silent</th>			<th>Alice Betrays</th>		</tr>		<tr>			<th>Bob Stays Silent</th>			<td>Both serve 1 year</td>			<td>Alice serves 3 years, Bob goes free</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<th>Bob Betrays</th>			<td>Alice goes free, Bob serves 3 years</td>			<td>Both serve 2 years</td>		</tr>	</table>	<p>Now, Alice and Bob are faced with a difficult decision. Should they trust their partner and stay silent, hoping that the other would do the same? Or should they betray the other, ensuring their own freedom at the expense of their partner's?</p>	<h2>Your Turn, Alice</h2>	<p>What would you choose?
